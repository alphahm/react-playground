# react-playground
A collection of packages to quickly start playing with [React](https://reactjs.org/ "React").
This makes use of babel, webpack and lite-server.

To start coding, just clone, install and run.

```
git clone https://github.com/alphahm/react-playground.git
`````

```
cd react-playground
```

```
npm install
```

```
npm start
```

The application will run in the default browser on localhost:3000. To change the port, edit ``bs-config.json`` in the root folder.

Entry point is ``src/index.js`` where a **Hello** component (the obligatory Hello World) is rendered into **div#root** in **index.html** located in the root folder.
